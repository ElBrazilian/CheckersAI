# __AI PROJECT - DAMES FRANCAISES__ <!--- # "Comment" Use CTRL+SHIFT+V to view the markdown -->

This AI doesn't use any transposition table, because after implementing it I realised that it was slower than without them, probably because of a problem in my implementation. 

## __PROGRAMS__

### make main:
  * brief   : builds the AI as ```out/main```

### make raco:
  * brief   : builds the graphic interface as racket/dames-interface

### make clean:
  * brief   : removes all .o files

### make play-first:
  * brief   : launches a game where the AI plays first, against you
  * you NEED to run make raco manually before

### make play-second:
  * brief   : launches a game where the AI plays second, against you
  * you NEED to run make raco manually before

### make play-solo:
  * brief   : launches a game without AI ?? 
  * you NEED to run make raco manually before

### make ai-battle:
  * brief   : launches a game where two AIs play against each other
  * you NEED to run make raco manually before
